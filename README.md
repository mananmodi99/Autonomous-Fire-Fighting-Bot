This project deals with the working of a simple robot
that uses Arduino IDE. The main idea of the project is to
make a robot that will move towards an area where
there is fire and spray water around the place to put off
the fire. This enables us to learn the underlying concepts
of robotics. This will further serve as the base for
construction of more complex and sophisticated robots.

Components Required:
• Arduino UNO
• Fire sensor or Flame sensor (3 Nos)
• Servo Motor (SG90)
• L293D motor Driver module
• Small Breadboard
• Robot chassis with motors and wheel (any type)
• A small can
• Connecting wires

The robots have sensors that have an IR receiver which
detects fire. This is because of the fact that burning fire
emits a small amount of infra- red light. This light is
received by the IR receiver of the sensor module.
Our robot is driven towards the fire using the L293D
module. Once near the fire water is to be sprayed on it.
We use a small container of water which is pumped by a
5V pump. The pump is placed in the container which is 
then placed on top of a servo motor so that we can
control the direction in which the water is being sprayed.
